Need to add multiple light sources
Make sure the lights make the generated shape viewable to where you can see the different layers and not just look like a block of cubes (If you can't do this with lights figure out a way to color the cubes so they look good and not just random colors)
Fix the weird cubes looking like lines thing better than just not enabling face culling
Code cleanup (remove commented out code and change whatever else to make it look better)
Make it run faster
Add GUI?
